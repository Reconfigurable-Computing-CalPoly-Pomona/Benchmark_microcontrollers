# Benchmark_microcontrollers

Microcontrollers are the processor of choice
for most electronic projects. With hundreds of thousands
available for sale, this project aims to find the most
important specifications of a microcontroller. We wrote a
benchmark testing the ALU, FPU, and memory access speed
and test four microcontrollers and one ALU+FPU implemented
on an FPGA.
